%
% This function simulates data from the model
%
% X = F*Lambda' + e
%
% 1) X is a T X N matrix of simulated data;
%
% 2) F T X r(s+1) matrix of static factors (dynamic factors and thier lags), 
%    r is the number of dynamic factors, 
%    s is the number of lagged dynamic factors 
%
% 3) Lambda N X r(s+1) matrix of the factor laodings 
% 
% 4) e T X N matrix of the idiosyncratic component
%
% INPUTS:
% T      - number of observations
% N      - number of cross sections
% alpha  - ar parameter on factors
% a      - ar parameter on the idiosyncratic components
% b      - cross correlation of idiosyncratic shocks
% r      - # of dynamic factors
% s      - # of lags of dynamic factors
% Lambda - matrix of loadings (this input is optional, 
%          if it is not given the function generates
%          a matrix of loadings)
% R      - Matrix of commonalities
